# Self_Driving_Car
In this repository I will share the source code of all the projects of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.  Hope this might be useful to someone! :-)


This code helps in getting the steering angle of self driving car. The inspiraion is taken from Udacity Self driving car module as well End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars module from NVIDIA.
